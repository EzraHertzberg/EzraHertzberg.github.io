<p id = storyp>The <strong>Tyler Bar</strong> was created in order to make people <strong>fitter</strong> and more  <strong>buff</strong>. We wanted to make a bar packed with not only protein, but creatine too. The <strong>Tyler Bar</strong> is easier to pack than a tub of protein powder or creatine. This way you can take your <strong>gains</strong> with you, wherever you go. This dream is what led to the creation of the <strong>Tyler Harrison Creatine Bar Company.</strong> So far the company has created <strong>0 creatine bars</strong>, but that will change once we open the <strong>Tyler Harrison Creatine Bar Factory.</strong></p>
